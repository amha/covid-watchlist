Covid 19 Watchlist

## About

News coverage of the pandemic is nearly identical to news coverage of the stock market. A measurement, for instance, is identified and presented within a dramatic frame that behaviorally informs or entertains or both. I decided to remove journalistic forms in the app’s presentation.

In doing so, the experience abandons narrative; the emphasis here is purely quantitative. The presentation should be familiar to anyone who monitors the stock market. Aside from a few deliberate ‘specials’ or lists of ‘notable people’, we don’t have a good way of engaging with the human, qualitative aspect, of the pandemic.
